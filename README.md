# Anchor: The AI Literacy Mentor ⚓

> **Turning Workforce Panic into AI Fluency.**

Built for the **AI Agents Waterloo Voice Hackathon**, Anchor is the psychological bridge between human anxiety and technological adoption.

## 🛑 The Problem: The "AI Anxiety Gap"
According to recent studies, **80% of the workforce** knows they need to adopt AI, but **60% are too overwhelmed** to even start. 

Traditional upskilling fails because it treats humans like processors—delivering technical documentation to people in a state of fight-or-flight. Employees are paralyzed by the **'Fear of Obscurity.'** Anchor solves for the human before it solves for the tool.

## ✨ The Solution: The Empathy Engine
Anchor is a mobile-first, voice-native mentor designed to act as a **Psychological Safety Engine**. 

It operates on a high-fidelity feedback loop:
1.  **De-escalate Panic**: Validates user fears in real-time to lower cortisol levels.
2.  **Diagnose Literacy**: Swiftly identifies true AI literacy levels through natural conversation.
3.  **Upskill**: Delivers role-specific micro-lessons (moving from Novice to Agentic).

**Privacy-First by Design:** No login, no data silos, local sessions only. It’s designed to be a "Confessional for the Future."

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture
Anchor is built for speed, trust, and zero friction.

*   **Voice Stack**: Powered by **Smallest.ai (Atom Model)**. We achieved sub-100ms latency, critical for maintaining the "Deep Empathy" tone required for mental health trust.
*   **Frontend**: Responsive **React + Vite** architecture with a focus on high-fidelity animations and mobile-first accessibility.
*   **Logic Engine**: A custom **State-Machine Prompting** system that detects emotional nuances in voice and dynamically swaps curriculum modules based on detected anxiety levels.

## 🌊 Sponsor Integration: Why Smallest.ai?
We chose **Smallest.ai Waves** over standard LLM-voice wrappers because **latency and prosody** are non-negotiable for psychological safety. 

If a mentor lags for 5 seconds after a user confesses a fear, the trust is broken. Smallest.ai’s lightning-fast inference allowed us to create a truly responsive, human-like guide that unblocks professionals in real-time.
